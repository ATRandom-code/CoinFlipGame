# CoinFlipGame

To play the game, all you have to do is run the code in a Python interpreter. It will prompt you to guess if the coin flip will be heads or tails and you can keep guessing until you get it right. If you get the guess correct, your score will increase and a new coin flip will be simulated. If you get the guess wrong, the game will end and your final score will be displayed.

I hope you have fun playing this game! Let me know if you have any questions.
